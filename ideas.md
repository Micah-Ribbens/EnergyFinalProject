1. Be a good citizen of the earth and then through that the neighbor will follow. They will get all the money in the

2. Do not be a good citizen and destroy the planet (steal the cows and make the cheap yet destructive choices)

# Technology Ideas:
1. LED technology through the security camera on the roof
