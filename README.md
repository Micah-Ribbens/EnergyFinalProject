# Summary
This was a game that I made for my energy class. It explores the dynamics of the prisoner's dilemna and how that relates
to Energy. The game has two players: the main player and an enemy. The enemy is harming the environment by having many
cows and the main player is helping the environment through their lentil farm. The game's goal is framed as 
having the enemy lose all their money. The player can do this by choosing technology that harms the environment, 
but is profitable and by stealing the enemy's cows. However, in so doing they destroy the environment. The only way to 
get the true ending is to choose technology that helps the environment and by only harvesting the lentils. Then the enemy 
will see the player's good energy choices and will follow suit. This is a simplistic version of how life works. By having 
good energy choices the individual may at first suffer, but in the long run the group will benefit. And when the group benefits,
so do all the individuals. This repository is just the code for the project, but I did create original assets and scenes for the project.
